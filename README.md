# open-data-gallery
*Open-data Gallery* is a proposal of standard for storage and interchange images its metada and/or captions. Open storage with [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) and open interchange by [open formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data). 

-----

This proposal use the Open Knowledge's [Data Packaged Core Datasets](https://github.com/datasets) conventions for store data in a [five-star open format](http://5stardata.info/en/).

Digital photo galleries, product catalogs, etc. are usual in websites, personal and professional repositories... But online services (like Facebook, Instagram, Wix, Picasa, etc.) and even [CMS tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system), like Wordpress, etc. are't interchangeable.

# Objective
Fix some conventions to get better datainterchange.
